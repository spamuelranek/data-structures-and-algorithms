# Stack and Queues
- a data structure that is dynamic in structure in the fact the data points do not need to be stored with each other because they carry references to the following items like linked lists, but queues work on the concept of First In First Out and Stacks First In Last Out

## Challenge
- Create a Stack class and Queue class that allows to add nodes to both and follows the concepts identified above

## Approach & Efficiency
- Followed the examples from class and the Code Fellows reading about stack and queues as inspriation
- #### Stack
- is_empty Time: O(1) Space: O(1)
- peek Time: O(1) Space: O(1)
- pop Time: O(1) Space: O(1)
- push Time: O(1) Space: O(1)
- #### Queue
- is_empty Time: O(1) Space: O(1)
- peek Time: O(1) Space: O(1)
- deq Time: O(1) Space: O(1)
- enq Time: O(1) Space: O(1)
