## Challenge
- Create a queue that takes in specific instances and dequeues a specific type of instances

## Approach & Efficiency
- Followed the examples from class and the Code Fellows reading about linked lists as inspriation
- enqueue has time complexity of O(1) and space complexity of 0(1)
- dequeue has time complexity of O(N) and space complexity of O(1)


## API
