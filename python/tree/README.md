## Challenge
- Create a binary tree that has a pre/in/post order
- Create a binary search tree that has an add method and a contains method

## Approach & Efficiency
- Followed the examples from class and the Code Fellows reading about linked lists as inspriation
- pre/in/post order has O("h") time complexity and a O(n) for space complexity. h being the height of the tree.
- add has O(logN) time complexity due to the binary search nature and has a O(1) for space
- contains has O(logN) time complexity and has O(1) for space

## API
- No Apis used
