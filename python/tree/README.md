## Challenge
- Create a binary tree that has a pre/in/post order
- Create a binary search tree that has an add method and a contains method

## Approach & Efficiency
- Followed the examples from class and the Code Fellows reading about linked lists as inspriation
- pre/in/post order has O("h") time complexity and a O(n) for space complexity. h being the height of the tree.
- add has O(logN) time complexity due to the binary search nature and has a O(1) for space
- contains has O(logN) time complexity and has O(1) for space

## API
- No Apis used

## Challenge: Add find Max value
- Create a binary tree that has an max method and returns the value that is the greatest

## Approach & Efficiency
- Followed the examples from class as inspriation and worked with Branno Starnes and Joseph Streifelgit
- pre order max finder has O(N) time complexity and a O(1) for space complexity.
