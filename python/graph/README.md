# Graphs
- Graphs are the superset of trees. They can be directional or not. They are a system that can keep track of unconnected nodes. They can have specific cycles

## Challenge
Create a Graph class that has add_node, add_edge, get_nodes, get_neighbors, size methods

## Approach & Efficiency
- Followed the examples from class and the Code Fellows reading about Graphs as inspriation
- Big O
    - Time for the most part it has a O(1) in fact all of them
    - Space is going to be dependent on the entire graph, but all the individual methods it has an O(1)

## API
- None
