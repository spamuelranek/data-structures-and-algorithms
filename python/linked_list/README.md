# Singly Linked List
- a data structure that is dynamic in structure in the fact the data points do not need to be stored with each other because they carry references to the following items

## Challenge
- Create a linked list using Nodes that have a value and a reference to the following node

## Approach & Efficiency
- Followed the examples from class and the Code Fellows reading about linked lists as inspriation
- Insert has O(1)
- Includes has O(N)
- __str__ has O(N)

## API
- No Apis used


# Linked List Insertions

## Challenge
- Create methods to insert nodes into an exisiting linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
- Followed the examples from class and the Code Fellows reading about linked lists as inspriation
- insert_before has O(N)
- insert_after has O(N)
- append has O(N)

## API
- No Apis used

# kth position of linked list

## Challenge
- Create methods to return the value of the kth node in a list

## Approach & Efficiency
- Worked from the idea of creating my own index of the list and then using it to move a certain amount through the linked list
- kth_from_end has O(N)

## API
- No Apis used
